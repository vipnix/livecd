# Vipnix LiveCD Linux

Vipnix LiveCD is a portable, bootable Linux distribution built on the legacy of Gentoo, Funtoo, and Macaroni OS. It combines Gentoo's source-based optimization, Funtoo's innovative tools, and Macaroni OS's modern, container-friendly approach. Designed for enthusiasts, professionals, and system recovery, this LiveCD runs directly from a USB or DVD without installation.

## Origins and Heritage

### Gentoo Linux
Originally named *Enoch Linux* by Daniel Robbins in the early 2000s, Gentoo was developed to provide high-performance, hardware-optimized systems without precompiled binaries. Named after the swift Gentoo penguin, it introduced the EGCS compiler (later merged into GCC) and the modular Portage package manager, known for its flexibility and ease of maintenance.

### The Rise of Funtoo Linux
Funtoo Linux, another notable project by Daniel Robbins, was conceived after his extensive experience with Gentoo. Robbins worked tirelessly to build stable stages, integrate technologies such as Git with Portage, and create tools such as Metro and ego, which further improved the user experience. Over the years, Funtoo has proven to be an agile and innovative distribution, adapting and evolving with the needs of the community. However, in August 2024, Robbins announced the closure of the project, with no possibility for any developer to keep the project alive. In short, he locked the door and threw away the key, removed everything from Funtoo that was online, and froze the mediawiki. We know that Daniel Robbins is very ‚Äúsentimental‚Äù, having even banned members for making simple jokes about Biden and Ukraine. That's life, it was good while it lasted, and it was also useful for bringing people together around the world, and almost all of the former Funtoo developers are now on the MacaroniOS project.

### Macaroni OS
With the end of Funtoo, we migrated our LiveCD to Macaroni OS, a distribution that was born as a project incubated under Funtoo Linux and has now evolved independently. Developed by Daniele Rondina, former developer of Sabayon Linux, Macaroni OS maintains the philosophy of performance and flexibility, offering a robust and up-to-date experience. It is not a fork of Funtoo because the tools are its own, and better.

## Vipnix LiveCD: A Fusion of Legacies

Vipnix LiveCD is based on Macaroni OS, with contributions from Vipnix and Funtoo developers. It integrates the lightweight LXQt desktop environment and the educational XLIBRE X-server, making it suitable for live use, system rescue, demonstrations, and on-the-go productivity.
